## ⚙️ Local Setup (For Testing)

# Step 1: Clone the repo
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-user/smart-agri-app.git
cd smart-agri-app

```
# step 2: Setup everything 
set the GROQ_API_KEY in a .env file inside and as : Backend/API/.env



# Step 3: Build and run everything locally
```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

### Access Services Locally:

* 🧠 FastAPI: `http://localhost:8000`
* 🌱 React App: `http://localhost:3001`
* 📊 Grafana: `http://localhost:3000`
* 📈 Prometheus: `http://localhost:9090`

## ☁️ GCP + Kubernetes Deployment

### 🔧 Step 1: Provision Infra with Terraform

```bash
cd terraform
terraform init
terraform apply -auto-approve
```

### 🐳 Step 2: Push Docker Images

Make sure Docker images are built and pushed to Docker Hub.

### ☁️ Step 3: CI/CD via GitHub Actions

GitHub workflows will handle automatic deployment on push to `main`:

| Component      | Workflow File                                   |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| FastAPI API    | `.github/workflows/fastapi-deployment.yml`      |
| React Frontend | `.github/workflows/react-app-deployment.yml`    |
| Model Server   | `.github/workflows/model-server-deployment.yml` |
| Prometheus     | `.github/workflows/prometheus-deployment.yml`   |
| Grafana        | `.github/workflows/grafana-deployment.yml`      |

### 🔐 Secrets Required

In your GitHub repo settings:

```
GKE_CREDENTIALS       = GCP service account key JSON
GCP_PROJECT           = your-gcp-project-id
DOCKER_USERNAME       = your-docker-username
DOCKER_PASSWORD       = your-docker-password
```

## 📦 KEDA: Autoscaling Magic

Two KEDA ScaledObjects configured:

* `keda-fastapi-scaledObject.yaml`: Autoscale FastAPI API pods based on queue length or traffic.
* `keda-model-server-scaledObject.yaml`: Autoscale model serving pods based on load.

Located in respective subfolders of `k8s/`

---

## 📊 Observability Stack

### Prometheus:

* Configured via `Backend/prometheus/prometheus.yml`
* Deployed via GitHub Actions to GKE

### Grafana:

* Comes with pre-installed dashboards.
* Exposed on GKE via `k8s/grafana/service.yaml`

---

## 🧠 Model Pipeline

* Model training logic lives in `Backend/model/`
* TorchServe Dockerized model server setup in `k8s/model-server/`
* Supports retraining and pushing updated model via CI/CD

---

## 🚨 Monitoring

Prometheus scrapes FastAPI metrics, model server stats, and autoscaling events. Integrated with Grafana dashboards for real-time visualization.
